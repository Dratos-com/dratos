Agent {sender_id} sends a message to Agent {receiver_id}:
Message Content:
- Task: {task}
- Data: {data}
This appears to be a custom, human-readable template format rather than a formal grammar specification like Lark. It's designed for ease of understanding and use, particularly for defining agent communication structures. Here's a breakdown of its components:

1. It uses placeholders enclosed in curly braces {} to represent variable parts of the message.
2. It has a clear, hierarchical structure with main sections and subsections.
3. It uses natural language to describe the communication flow and message components.

While this format is more readable than Lark, it's important to note that it's not a formal grammar specification. It's more of a template or structured format for defining agent communication patterns. This approach can be useful for:

1. Quickly prototyping communication structures
2. Providing clear documentation for developers and non-technical stakeholders
3. Serving as a basis for generating more formal grammars or code implementations

If you need a formal grammar specification, you might consider translating this format into Lark or another grammar specification language, depending on your specific requirements and the tools you're using in your project.
