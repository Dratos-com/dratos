# Tests
Test within dratos use doctest. Doctests are here to make sure your code does what it says in the docstring. With our setup, testing is efficient, and youâ€™re not constantly hitting external APIsâ€”saving you time, money, and sanity..

- **First Run:** When you first run a test, itâ€™ll hit the real API, grab the response, and store it in `testdata.json`.
- **Later Runs:** After that, tests use the local API with the saved responsesâ€”no more API calls.

## Running Tests

```bash
pytest -v --doctest-modules examples/test*
```
- Add `-s` flag captures all the output

Ensure the correct Python interpreter is being used:
```bash
python3 -m pytest
```

## Writing Tests

- **Location:** All test files go in the `examples` folder. Files must start with `test_` so PyTest knows whatâ€™s up.
- **Function Naming:** Donâ€™t start function names with `test_`, or PyTest will treat them as regular PyTest tests. You can still write PyTest tests separately if you want.
- **Verbose=False:** Always set verbose to `False` to prevent anything printed in the terminal from being interpreted as part of the expected response in the doctest.

```python
def example_function():
    """
    >>> example_function()
    result
    """
    # Function logic here
```

ðŸ›‘ **PRO TIP** ðŸ›‘ **First Run:** Run the test, get the actual response from the terminal, copy-paste it into the docstring.

# Streaming responses
Note that when streaming responses, two streams cannot be simultaneously streamed in the terminal. And so in that event, streams will be misformatted. However a single stream can be streamed simultanously by two distinct interface (e.g. terminal and app, etc)

Two functions within the Agent class: `sync_gen()` returns the complete response once it's generated and `async_gen()`. async_gen() support response streaming.


# Qdrant
Setup and Run Qdrant Locally:
The easiest way to run Qdrant locally is using Docker. Here are the steps:
```bash
# Pull the Qdrant image
docker pull qdrant/qdrant

# Run Qdrant
docker run -p 6333:6333 -p 6334:6334 \
    -v $(pwd)/qdrant_storage:/qdrant/storage:z \
    qdrant/qdrant
```

This will start Qdrant and make it accessible at:
REST API: localhost:6333
Dashboard: http://localhost:6333/dashboard
GRPC API: localhost:63341

To stop Qdrant, you can use Ctrl+C in the terminal where it's running, or stop using docker ui or use:
```bash
docker stop <container_id>
```
