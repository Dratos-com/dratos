Here's a user story about a product manager using AI agents to compress a design sprint into a single day:

# AI-Powered Design Sprint: From 5 Days to 1

Meet Sarah, a product manager at a fast-growing startup. She needed to prioritize features for their new app but was dreading the typical 5-day design sprint process. That's when she discovered our AI-powered design sprint platform.

## Morning: Setup and Problem Definition

Sarah started her day by initializing the AI agents she'd be working with:


```146:153:examples/notebooks/chat_example.ipynb
    "q1_agent = Agent(\n",
    "    llm=gemini_free,\n",
    "    tools=[CalculatorTool, DataframeTool],\n",
    "    context=[earnings],\n",
    "    memory={'short':[knowl]},\n",
    "    planning=\n",
    "    rethinking=\n",
    ")\n",
```


She set up specialized agents for user research, prototyping, and decision-making, each powered by different models optimized for their tasks.

## Mid-Morning: Lightning User Research

Sarah input her target user personas and product goals. The AI agents quickly:

1. Analyzed market trends and user behavior data
2. Conducted simulated user interviews
3. Generated user journey maps and empathy maps

All of this was done in a fraction of the time it would take a human team.

## Noon: Rapid Ideation and Prototyping

Using the insights gathered, Sarah and her AI team began ideation:

1. The brainstorming agent generated hundreds of feature ideas in minutes
2. The prioritization agent helped Sarah filter and rank these ideas based on user impact and feasibility
3. The prototyping agent created wireframes and interactive mockups for the top ideas

Sarah could iterate on designs in real-time, with the AI providing instant feedback and suggestions.

## Early Afternoon: User Testing Simulation

Instead of recruiting test users, Sarah used:


```79:111:api/deployments/agents/SpeechAgent.py
    async def _process_request(self, request: AgentRequest) -> str:
        transcription = ""
        if request.speech is not None:
            stt_response = await self.stt.remote(request.speech)
            transcription = stt_response[0]  # Assuming the first element is the transcription

        if request.prompt:
            request.prompt += "\n" + transcription
            messages = [{"role": "user", "content": request.prompt}]
        elif request.messages:
            if request.messages[-1]["role"] == "user":
                request.messages[-1]["content"] += " " + transcription
            else:
                request.messages.append({"role": "user", "content": transcription})
            messages = request.messages
        else:
            messages = [{"role": "user", "content": transcription}]

        if not messages:
            raise ValueError("No valid input provided")

        llm_response = await self.model.generate.remote(
                prompt = request.prompt,
                messages = request.messages,
                temperature=0.7,
                max_tokens=100,
            )
        )

        if isinstance(llm_response, ErrorResponse):
            raise ValueError(f"Error from LLM: {llm_response.message}")

        return llm_response.choices[0].message.content
```


This agent simulated diverse user interactions with the prototypes, providing detailed feedback and uncovering potential usability issues.

## Late Afternoon: Decision Making and Roadmap Creation

With all the data collected, Sarah used the decision-making agent to:

1. Analyze the pros and cons of each feature
2. Estimate development time and resources
3. Create a prioritized product roadmap

The agent even generated a presentation summarizing the day's findings and recommendations.

## Evening: Reflection and Next Steps

As Sarah wrapped up her one-day sprint, she was amazed at what she had accomplished:

- Comprehensive user research and analysis
- Multiple rounds of ideation and prototyping
- Simulated user testing with diverse scenarios
- A data-driven, prioritized product roadmap

What would have taken a team of people 5 full days was accomplished in just 8 hours, thanks to the AI-powered design sprint platform.

## The Impact

By using our AI-powered design sprint platform, Sarah:

1. Saved her company 4 days of collective team time
2. Explored 5x more feature ideas than in a traditional sprint
3. Gained insights from simulated interactions with 100x more users
4. Developed a product roadmap backed by data and AI-driven analysis

Sarah's team was able to start development on the highest-impact features immediately, giving them a significant head start in their competitive market.

This story showcases how our AI platform doesn't just speed up the design sprint processâ€”it fundamentally transforms it, allowing product managers like Sarah to make better, data-driven decisions in a fraction of the time.
