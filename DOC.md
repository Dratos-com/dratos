## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive framework for serving machine learning models, particularly focusing on language models. It offers support for various engines, including OpenAI, VLLM, Transformers, LlamaCpp, and Triton Server. The system is designed to be flexible, allowing easy integration of new models and engines.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several key directories:

- `beta/`: Core implementation of the project
  - `models/`: Model implementations and serving logic
  - `data/`: Data management and processing
  - `tools/`: Utility tools for various tasks
  - `agents/`: Agent implementations for task execution
- `api/`: API-related code, including deployments
- `examples/`: Example notebooks and usage demonstrations

## Setup

1. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Set up the necessary environment variables, including API keys for various services (e.g., OpenAI, VLLM).

3. Initialize the Ray cluster if using distributed computing features.

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use the system:

```python
python
from beta import Agent
from beta.models.serve.engines import OpenAIEngine
Initialize the engine
engine = OpenAIEngine(model_name="gpt-3.5-turbo", mlflow_client=mlflow.tracking.MlflowClient())
Create an agent
agent = Agent(engine=engine)
Generate text
response = agent.generate("Tell me a joke about programming.")
print(response)
```

## Components

### Engines

This project supports multiple engines for serving models. The current supported engines are:


For more detailed examples, refer to the notebooks in the `examples/` directory.

## Components

### Engines

The project supports various engines for model serving:

- OpenAI Engine: Interfaces with OpenAI's API
- VLLM Engine: Uses the VLLM library for efficient language model inference
- Transformers Engine: Utilizes Hugging Face's Transformers library
- LlamaCpp Engine: Integrates with the Llama.cpp library
- Triton Server Engine: Supports NVIDIA's Triton Inference Server

Each engine implements a common interface, allowing for easy swapping and integration of new engines.

### Models

The system supports various types of models, including:

- Language Models: For text generation and processing
- Speech-to-Text Models: For transcription tasks
- Structured Generation Models: For generating structured outputs

Models are implemented as subclasses of `BaseModel` and can be easily extended to support new model types.

### Tools

The project includes a set of utility tools that can be used by agents:

- Calculator Tool: For performing mathematical calculations
- Dataframe Tool: For working with structured data
- Knowledge Base Tool: For managing and querying a knowledge base

Tools are implemented as subclasses of `BaseTool` and can be easily extended to add new functionalities.

### Data Management

The project includes a robust data management system:

- Artifact Management: For handling various types of artifacts
- Document Management: For processing and storing textual documents
- Graph Management: For working with knowledge graphs

Data is managed using Ray for distributed computing and DeltaCat for efficient data storage and retrieval.

## Configuration

Configuration is managed through a combination of environment variables and configuration files. Key configuration options include:

- Model selection and parameters
- Engine-specific settings
- API keys and endpoints
- Data storage locations

Refer to the `config/` directory for detailed configuration options.
