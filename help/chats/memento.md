# **Memento: Conversational Time Travel for Large Language Models**

## Abstract
We propose **Memento**, a novel framework for versioning and navigating conversations with large language models (LLMs). Leveraging Git-like version control, Memento allows for conversational "time travel," enabling users to revisit, fork, and merge conversation states. By treating dialogue as source code, conversations can be collaboratively edited, branched into alternate threads, and optimized through iterative revisions. Memento facilitates dynamic, transparent, and modular interaction with LLMs, transforming conversational histories into rich, navigable data structures that foster collaborative dialogue.

## 1. **Introduction**

Language models (LMs) offer robust conversational capabilities, but current interactions lack long-term persistence, version control, or collaborative editing features. In traditional use, prompts and conversations with LMs are ephemeral, and there is no mechanism for tracking conversational changes, reverting to prior states, or forking conversations into multiple paths. We introduce **Memento**, a framework inspired by **Git** for treating conversations as **programmatic entities** that can be tracked, versioned, branched, and collaboratively modified over time.

### 1.1 **Motivation**
The rise of **LLMs** has resulted in increasingly complex and valuable conversations. However, managing these conversations lacks the tools available in software development, such as **version control**, **branching**, and **collaboration**. Conversations often change direction unpredictably, and users might want to revisit past moments, experiment with alternative conversational paths, or collaboratively refine the dialogue.

Memento aims to:
- Enable users to "travel" back to previous conversation states.
- Fork conversations to explore new directions while preserving the original thread.
- Allow collaboration on prompts and conversational outcomes.
- Merge different conversation paths back into the main thread after experimentation.

## 2. **Framework Overview**

Memento treats **conversations as code**, utilizing key principles of **version control**, modularity, and traceability:

### 2.1 **Conversation as a Repository**
Each conversation with an LLM is treated as a **Git repository**, where every message exchange (prompt-response pair) is a **commit**. These commits are timestamped and sequential, creating a structured conversational history.

### 2.2 **Versioning and Time Travel**
Users can navigate through previous conversation states by checking out **specific commits** (conversation snapshots). This provides an ability to:
- **Revert** to a specific conversational moment.
- View or edit past states.
- Explore "what-if" scenarios without disrupting the primary thread.

### 2.3 **Branching and Forking**
Like code, conversations can be **branched**. Forking a conversation allows users to explore alternate paths or outcomes without losing the original discussion:
- A user might fork the conversation at a critical point to experiment with different prompts or contexts.
- Branches can later be **merged** back into the main conversational thread or continue independently.

### 2.4 **Collaboration and Merge Requests**
Memento introduces collaborative editing for conversation workflows:
- Users can submit **pull requests** to propose changes to existing conversation states.
- Merging allows multiple versions of a conversation to converge, combining the best responses from different branches.

## 3. **System Architecture**

### 3.1 **Core Components**
- **Git as Backend**: We utilize Git for tracking conversation history, branching, and merging.
- **LanceDB for Storage**: Conversations and semantic data are stored in **LanceDB**, ensuring efficient retrieval of contextual information.
- **Ell for Prompt Management**: Ell serves as the prompt engineering engine, treating prompts as modular, versioned programs that can be executed and tracked.
- **Agent Layer**: An agent orchestrates the prompt-execution pipeline, storing results in LanceDB and version-controlling them with Git.

### 3.2 **Workflow**
1. **Initialization**: A new conversation begins by initializing a Git repository for that dialogue.
2. **Message Logging**: Each user interaction and LLM response is recorded as a Git commit.
3. **Forking and Branching**: Users can fork a conversation at any point to explore alternative paths.
4. **Collaboration**: Pull requests enable others to submit revisions, enhancing collective conversation management.
5. **Time Travel**: Users can traverse the conversation's commit history and revert or merge previous states.

### 3.3 **Data Schema**
Conversation data stored in LanceDB includes:
- **Conversation ID**.
- **Timestamp** for each interaction.
- **User and AI messages**.
- **Embedding data** for contextual understanding and efficient search.

## 4. **Case Study: Multi-Path Conversations**

We demonstrate Memento in action through a **multi-path conversation scenario**. A conversation about ethical AI begins with an open-ended discussion. At a key point, the user forks the conversation into three branches:
1. One branch explores AI regulation.
2. Another examines AI in healthcare.
3. The final branch delves into AI bias in datasets.

Each branch is allowed to evolve independently, but key insights are merged back into the main conversation, creating a richer and more nuanced dialogue.

## 5. **Applications**

- **Collaborative Prompt Engineering**: Memento enables teams to collaboratively develop and refine complex prompt workflows, optimizing LLM interactions.
- **Educational Platforms**: Instructors can fork and modify conversations for different learning paths, merging contributions from students into a central dialogue.
- **Interactive Storytelling**: Branching narrative paths in games or stories can be explored using Mementoâ€™s version control, allowing players to experiment with alternate storylines.

## 6. **Challenges and Future Work**

### 6.1 **Scalability**
Tracking large conversations over time could introduce performance bottlenecks. We plan to explore optimization techniques, including lazy loading and selective commit tracking.

### 6.2 **Conflict Resolution**
Like software, conversational branches may result in conflicting views that must be reconciled. We are developing semantic conflict resolution strategies to handle merge conflicts in dialogue.

### 6.3 **Enhanced Collaboration**
Future versions will integrate real-time collaboration, allowing multiple users to interact simultaneously on the same conversation thread.

## 7. **Conclusion**

Memento introduces a powerful paradigm for managing conversations with LLMs, treating dialogues as modular, version-controlled entities. By enabling time travel, branching, and collaboration, Memento fosters a rich, iterative, and highly collaborative environment for exploring complex conversational paths.
